/*
1 -
    Outputs 10 "*" vertically (each in a new line)

2 -
    a function that loops x (parameter) amount of times,
    every 3 steps, including 0, it will increase the "c" variable by 1 - essentially "Math.floor(x / 3);"
    in the end it returns the "c" variable

3 -
    a function that loops while x is bigger than 0 (x > 0)
    each time it divides x by 10 and adding +1 to the "c" variable, essentially counting how many times x can divide by 10
    after the loop ends it returns the "c" variable
